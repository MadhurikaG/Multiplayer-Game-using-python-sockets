Multiplayer Game using python sockets and pygame library
This is online multiplayer game with python using sockets and basic python networking. This is really cool and works on your local network. I have used pygame, sockets and threading to accomplish this.


To modify this to work on your computer 

Step 1 : go to CMD type ipconfig and find the ipv4 addrss of the machine that will be running the server. 
Step 2 : You must change the host attribute in the Network class to match this value.
